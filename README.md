# Python-Fine-Grained-Classification

## We are going to use the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. Our model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories. According to their paper, the best accuracy they could get in 2012 was 59.21%, using a complex model that was specific to pet detection, with separate "Image", "Head", and "Body" models for the pet photos. Let's see how accurate we can be using deep learning!
